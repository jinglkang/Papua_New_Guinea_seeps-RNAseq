# identify the single copy genes to construct a phylogentic tree for BAMM
## annotate the six species genes: align to uniprot and selected the longest when sequences were aligned to uniprot id with the same genes
working dir (SNORLAX): ~/CO2-seeps/annotation    
```bash
for fa in *.fasta; do ./annotate --fasta ${fa}; done
```
\*.ano were the annotations of sequences with blast hits    
\*.ano.longest were the annotations of sequences with blast hits, and select the longest when sequences were aligned to uniprot id with the same genes     
\*.ano.longest.fasta is the fasta file of \*.ano.longest
